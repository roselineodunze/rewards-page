# Rewards Page Recreation

This project is a recreation of the **rewards page** of a website. The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality and layout of the original rewards page, including the tabs, styles, and UI components.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) — [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) — Comes installed with Node.js
- **Git** — [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rewards-page.git

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Go into the directory of the project you just cloned:
    cd rewards-page

### 3. Install Dependencies

Next, install the required dependencies. This project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install them:
    npm install

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables (if applicable)

If your project has any environment variables (such as API keys or config settings), you should create a .env file in the root of the project and add them there. Example .env file:
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url-here

### 5. Running the Project Locally

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server to run the project locally:
    npm run dev

### Usage

Once the application is running locally, you can test the recreated rewards page. The page should include:

Tabs for different rewards statuses (All, Unlocked, Locked, Coming Soon).

Dynamic content to simulate the rewards counters.

Interactive design for a smooth user experience.
